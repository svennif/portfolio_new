                    I'm a proficient Frontend Developer with a diverse career journey. Starting with a decade-long tenure in retail management at Coop Obs Bryne, where I sharpened my customer service skills, I transitioned into the tech sector. My initial role was as an IT Consultant at Front Software, where I managed projects and worked extensively on digital control systems. Now, at Clerk.io, I serve as a Junior Integration Specialist, designing and implementing recommendation sliders for a variety of webshops using technologies like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, Smarty, and Liquid. Educationally, I hold a Bachelor's in New Media from the University of Bergen and a Higher Professional Degree in Frontend Development from Noroff. My belief in the importance of customer satisfaction reflects in my work, always ensuring a seamless user experience. In my free time, I stay updated with the latest in technology and UX design, and I enjoy outdoor activities for relaxation and rejuvenation. I am always eager for new challenges in the realm of frontend development.
